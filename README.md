# LDAvsPCA


This project is designed to understand the differences of LDA and PCA in detail. I have used the blood transfusion data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases. This project uses KNN and LR methods to classify and predict the values for given dataset. The best accuracy was found using KNN which is given as follows:

Training Score:  0.82
Test Score: 0.762096774194

Though sklearn has its own implementation of LDA and PCA, I have implemented them by myself and found quite the same results. Please feel free to give your suggestions to increase the accuracy if you have any.
